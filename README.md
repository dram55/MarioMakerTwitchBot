# MarioMakerTwitchBot
Take Level Requests from Twitch chat ```!submit 0000-1111-AAAA-EEEE```. Requests are only accepted while bot is in an 'Open' status. When bot is 'Closed' it randomly picks levels for you to play. Mods and subs have 5x increased odds their level will be picked. Levels can also be manually force added to the queue.

Submission status & current level are written to respective text files which can be used within OBS. (open.txt close.txt nextLevel.txt)

If desired, the current queue of levels can be embedded to an html page using {details} and {date} tags and FTP'd to a webserver of your choice. Viewers can refer to this. 

The goal of this bot is to take level submissions without being overwhelmed & having a huge queue.

### Documentation

	
### Building For the first time

 + On your first build the program will create an empty settings.xml & required files to the bin directory. 
 + Follow the instructions in the BotSource\Resources\ReadMe.txt and apply it to the settings.xml in your bin directory.
 + Your bot should now be able to connect.

#### Build Events
 + When BotRunner.csproj is built, a post-build event is ran and will put all relevant files to bin\Release\Publish. Use this directory to easily distribute the program. This contains an initialized settings.xml and queue.html which are copied from the BotSource\Resources directory - and do not contain any of your personal info.
